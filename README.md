# docker-binaryexploitation
Create a docker container that is purpose-built for binary exploitation using Linux CLI tooling. It is a repeatable build process and I don't need to provision a virtual machine to have all this. It ticks off Docker purists too, which is an added bonus. 

*Still working on getting this fully set up.* 

## Packages / Features
- emacs-nox
- rizin with a .radare2rc (rizin compatible?!)
- gdb + gef
- libc database 

## Usage
Build the docker container: `./build.sh`

Run the docker container: `./run.sh`

Get a shell in the container: `./shell.sh`

## Thanks
Thanks to @LiveOverflow for the video and idea. You rock!
