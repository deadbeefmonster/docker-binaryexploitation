# docker-binaryexploitation
Create a docker container that is purpose-built for binary exploitation using Linux CLI tooling. It is a repeatable build process and I don't need to provision a virtual machine to have all this. It ticks off Docker purists too, which is an added bonus. 


## Packages / Features
- Ubuntu 21.04
- emacs-nox, vim, jq, strace, ltrace
- rizin with a .rizinrc
- gdb + gef
- libc database
- ROPgadget
- pwntools
- ropper
- unicorn

## Usage
Build the docker container: `./build.sh`

Run the docker container: `./run.sh`

Get a shell in the container: `./shell.sh`

## Thanks
Thanks to @LiveOverflow for the video and idea. You rock!
